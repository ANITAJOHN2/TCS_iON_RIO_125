This project is to develop a model with an aim to detect different types of sentiment contained in a collection of English sentences or a paragraph and accurately predict the overall sentiment of the paragraph.

Social networking platforms have become an essential means for communicating feelings to the entire world due to rapid expansion in the Internet era. Several people use textual content, pictures, audio, and video to express their feelings or viewpoints. Text communication via Web-based networking media, on the other hand, is somewhat overwhelming. Every second, a massive amount of unstructured data is generated on the Internet due to social media platforms. The data must be processed as rapidly as generated to comprehend human psychology and it can be accomplished using sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis refers to identifying as well as classifying the sentiments that are expressed in the text source. It assesses whether the author has a negative, positive, or neutral attitude toward an item, administration, individual, or location.

Tweets are often useful in generating a vast amount of sentiment data upon analysis. These data are useful in understanding the opinion of people on social media for a variety of topics.

Solution Approach:

Data collection and Preprocessing: Identify and finalize a dataset containing user comments and associated sentiments. Used Twitter dataset. Did required preprocessing like text cleaning, tokenization, stop words removal.

Model Building: Develop models for detection and segmentation of sentiments whether positive, negative or neutral from the paragraph using multiple algorithms and different vectorization techniques. Used Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes, Logistic Regression, KNeighbors Classifier algorithms and CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer for text vectorization.

Model Evaluation: Train, validate, and fine-tune each model using appropriate evaluation metrics.
Compare the accuracy of different models and finalize the best model.
